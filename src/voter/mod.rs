//! A voter in GRANDPA. This transitions between rounds and casts votes.
//!
//! Voters rely on some external context to function:
//!   - setting timers to cast votes.
//!   - incoming vote streams.
//!   - providing voter weights.
//!   - getting the local voter id.
//!
//!  The local voter id is used to check whether to cast votes for a given
//!  round. If no local id is defined or if it's not part of the voter set then
//!  votes will not be pushed to the sink. The protocol state machine still
//!  transitions state as if the votes had been pushed out.
